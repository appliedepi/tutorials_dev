```{r appliedepi-hexes, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hex-sidebyside.png")
```


## Data used and directory structure

In this tutorial we will use the following datasets. Please take a few minutes to review the structure and content of each dataset before continuing.

Use the arrows on the right to scroll through hidden columns. Note that these are "raw" (messy) datasets that mimic problems commonly found in real-life epidemiological datasets.  


### **A "linelist" of cases in a fictional (not real) Ebola outbreak***

A "linelist" is a term used in applied epidemiology to refer to a table that contains key information about each case or suspect case in an outbreak. Each row represents one case, and the columns contain variables such as age, sex, date of symptom onset, outcomes, etc.

This dataset contains `r nrow(linelist_raw)` rows and `r ncol(linelist_raw)` columns. Below are the first 5 rows:  

```{r}
head(linelist_raw)
```

Click to [download the **raw** dataset](https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_raw.xlsx) for your own practice.

Click to [download the **clean** dataset as an **.rds file**](https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds) for your own practice. A *.rds file* is an R-specific file type that preserves column classes. This ensures you will have only minimal cleaning to do after importing the data into R.

### **Aggregated data from malaria surveillance in a fictional country**  

Aggregated data in epidemiology usually means a table of counts for each facility, or district, etc. Sometimes, the counts can also be per day, week, or month.  

In this fictional dataset, each facility reported *daily* case counts of rapid-test (RDT)-confirmed malaria. Thus, each row represents the number of cases for a specific facility on a specific day.  

This dataset contains `r nrow(malaria_counts)` rows and `r ncol(malaria_counts)` columns. Below are the first 5 rows:  

```{r}
head(malaria_counts)
```


Click to [download the **clean** malaria counts dataset as an **.rds file**](https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/malaria_facility_count_data.rds) for your own practice. A *.rds file* is an R-specific file type that preserves column classes. This ensures you will have only minimal cleaning to do after importing the data into R.

## Install and Load R packages {#packages}

To use basic functions with public health data, the tidyverse metapackage is very useful. Tidyverse loads the dplyr, ggplot2, and other packages that are useful in epi data analysis. 

We've preloaded the below packages for now. Installation and loading of these packages is described on the EpiRHandbook [_Suggested Packages_](https://epirhandbook.com/en/suggested-packages-1.html) page. 


In this assignment we'll work with X R packages, let's load them!

```{r load-package, exercise = TRUE}
pacman::p_load(___)
```

```{r load-package-hint}
pacman::p_load(rio, here, janitor, tidyverse)

```

```{r load-package-check}
grade_this_code("You are correct, the packages you need for this lesson are now loaded!")
```

```{r eval= FALSE}
pacman::p_load(learnr, here, rio, janitor, tidyverse)
```

### Recommended R packages for public health

See this Epi R Handbook LINK for our recommended packages.









## Import data {#import} 

Import that data and save it as "raw" file

To import data from a sub-folder, the `import()` command should be modified so that it correctly tells R where to search for this file. This is done using the here() function. 

```{r import-demo-subfolder, echo=T, eval=F}
linelist_raw <- import(here("data", "linelist_raw.xlsx"))   # import data and save as named object
```




## ggplot basics

There are a number of visualisation options within the R software but in this tutorial and the handbook we focus on the **ggplot2** package available within the tidyverse. This is the visualisation package of choice for may epidemiologists and other R users as it has a number of benefits over the basic `plot()` function builit in to R.
**ggplot2**:
* Is good for fast data exploration (especially with large numbers of parameters)
* Produces very high quality final outputs which can often be used directly in publications or reports
* has well structured and consistent inputs, once you learn the basics you can apply the same techniques to many data and plot types
* Is actively updated and built on with additional packages to extend functionality


### Grammar of graphics
Visualising multi-dimensional data *well* is a fine line between art and science. Visualisation is one of the most important parts of a statistical analysis as it allows you to share what you have achieved and, when done correctly, can help to explain complex work and concepts to a wider audience of stakeholders or the general public. Visualisation can also be a key step when getting to grips with new data orwith analyses you are working on.

***VIS OF ANSCOMBES QuARTET OR SIMILAR***

The "grammar of graphics" was first introduced by Leland Wilkinson in the book ["The grammar of Graphics"](***link to springer***) but here relates to the layered grammar of graphics framework which ggplot is based on. 

***pyramid illustration from towards data science is nice here***

***qu on data being the basic building block of all vis***

In **ggplot2** we build a plot by "adding" commands on top of one another which specify plot layers and design elements.
For a standard plot your order will follow this process:

1. **"Open" the plot** with the `ggplot()` command and specify the dataset
2. **"Map" data columns** to "aesthetic" features of the plot such as axes, colour, size, shape fill, transparency etc. 
3. **Add "geom" layers** to visualise your data in the desired way
4. **Modify "scales"** such as colour choices, axis breaks
5. **Add "theme" design elements** to your plot such as axis labels, title, captions, fonts, text sizes, background themes and the orientation of different elemnets

"Adding" layers to your plot is done literally, by ending a ggplot line with the `+` symbol you can indicate that you wish to add further details on the following line. This can be repeated until your complete plot is built. Using this line-by-line syntax allows your code to be more readable, both to you to make changes in the future and to others trying to understand your work.



## Grammar of graphics in action
We will now try applying this layered system to some example data to practice visualising data.

### 1. "Open" the plot
The **ggplot2** package is built around the **R** function `ggplot()` which is the first command for any ggplot. 
Running `ggplot()` in your R console should generate a blank canvas:

```{r ggplot empty}
ggplot()
```

We assign the dataframe we wish to use with the data parameter of this function: 
```{r ggplot data}
ggplot(data = linelist)
```


If you are familiar with the pipe operator (`%>%`) from our XXXX tutorial, data can also be passed into a ggplot command using a pipe.

## 2. Map data columns with `aes()`
```{r aes}


```




***choose some data columns to plot, open and inspect the data, pick our columns***
***intro the idea of data= and aes()***


## Add geoms
***concept of geoms on a new line in the grammar setup***
***examples of these geoms on our sample data***

***qu where the plus is missing from the code so they need to add one in to join the lines***


## Scales
***log, axis lims etc.***


### colors
***premade palettes***
***add the ggplot colour list maybe? or link it ***
***hex values***

### y-axis breaks


## Theme elements
***this part could be its own chapter - some basics plus built in themes***

## Facets



## Common epidemiological plots
***egs from book***
### Epidemic cuves

### Bar plots
#### Horizontal
#### Labels
### Demographic pyramids

## Order (facets)

## Labels

### Dynamic labels

## Dual axes

## Data structure
### Pivoting

## Next steps
Some good example plots with accompanying code can be found on the [R graph gallery](r-graph-gallery.com) to use for inspiration with your own plotting goals and projects.

Interactive plotting, can use 2 axes, colour, size and 2 facet directions, for more dimensions interactivity or movement are usually the next steps - plotly




##  TEMPLATE Exercises

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
