## Data used and directory structure

In this tutorial we will use the following datasets. Please take a few minutes to review the structure and content of each dataset before continuing.

Use the arrows on the right to scroll through hidden columns. Note that these are "raw" (messy) datasets that mimic problems commonly found in real-life epidemiological datasets.  


### **A "linelist" of cases in a fictional (not real) Ebola outbreak***

A "linelist" is a term used in applied epidemiology to refer to a table that contains key information about each case or suspect case in an outbreak. Each row represents one case, and the columns contain variables such as age, sex, date of symptom onset, outcomes, etc.

This dataset contains `r nrow(linelist_raw)` rows and `r ncol(linelist_raw)` columns. Below are the first 5 rows:  

```{r}
head(linelist_raw)
```

Click to [download the **raw** dataset](https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_raw.xlsx) for your own practice.

Click to [download the **clean** dataset as an **.rds file**](https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds) for your own practice. A *.rds file* is an R-specific file type that preserves column classes. This ensures you will have only minimal cleaning to do after importing the data into R.

### **Aggregated data from malaria surveillance in a fictional country**  

Aggregated data in epidemiology usually means a table of counts for each facility, or district, etc. Sometimes, the counts can also be per day, week, or month.  

In this fictional dataset, each facility reported *daily* case counts of rapid-test (RDT)-confirmed malaria. Thus, each row represents the number of cases for a specific facility on a specific day.  

This dataset contains `r nrow(malaria_counts)` rows and `r ncol(malaria_counts)` columns. Below are the first 5 rows:  

```{r}
head(malaria_counts)
```


Click to [download the **clean** malaria counts dataset as an **.rds file**](https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/malaria_facility_count_data.rds) for your own practice. A *.rds file* is an R-specific file type that preserves column classes. This ensures you will have only minimal cleaning to do after importing the data into R.

##  TEMPLATE Exercises

### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaulated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
